2. **Speech Recognition** - Extract text from audio
3. **Translation** - Translate to target languages
4. **Voice Synthesis** - Generate dubbed audio
5. **Face Animation** - Sync facial movements
6. **Quality Check** - Verify output quality

#### Real-time Updates

## Understanding Quality Modes

### Structural-Based Mode (Recommended)
- **Best Quality**: Uses 3D face reconstruction and neural rendering
- **Processing Time**: Slower but higher fidelity
- **Best For**: Professional content, marketing videos, films
- **Technology**: FLAME 3D model + DAE-Talker renderer

### End-to-End Mode
- **Faster Processing**: Direct audio-to-video generation
- **Processing Time**: 3-5x faster than structural mode
- **Best For**: Social media, quick prototypes, drafts
- **Technology**: Diffusion-based models (DiffTalk, DiffusedHeads)

## Language Support

### Tier 1 Languages (Highest Quality)
English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean

### Tier 2 Languages (High Quality)
Arabic, Hindi, Thai, Vietnamese, Turkish, Polish, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian

### Tier 3 Languages (Good Quality)
Finnish, Greek, Hebrew, Czech, Hungarian, Romanian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Slovak, Slovenian

*And 30+ additional languages with varying quality levels*

## Tips for Best Results

### Video Quality
- **Resolution**: 720p or higher recommended
- **Lighting**: Well-lit faces improve detection
- **Audio**: Clear speech without background noise
- **Duration**: Shorter clips (under 10 minutes) process faster

### Audio Considerations
- **Voice Cloning**: Provide at least 30 seconds of clear speech
- **Multiple Speakers**: Each speaker needs separate voice samples
- **Background Music**: Lower volume for better speech extraction

### Content Guidelines
- **Face Visibility**: Ensure faces are clearly visible
- **Minimal Occlusion**: Avoid hands covering faces
- **Stable Shots**: Reduce camera shake for better tracking
- **Single Speaker**: Best results with one primary speaker

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Face Not Detected"
- Ensure face is clearly visible and well-lit
- Try a different video segment
- Check if face is too small in frame

#### "Poor Audio Quality"
- Upload video with clearer audio
- Reduce background noise
- Ensure speaker is audible throughout

#### "Translation Seems Incorrect"
- Use human review option for important content
- Provide context in project description
- Consider manual translation upload

#### "Lip Sync Issues"
- Try structural mode for better sync
- Check if original audio matches video
- Ensure face is facing camera
